    "I spend most of my time building with React and Next.js. For smaller client-side products, I’ll often use Vite. When a product needs stronger routing, content, SEO, or backend work, I usually reach for Next.js with Supabase and Postgres.\n\nOn the interface side, I work with shadcn/ui, coss UI, Base UI, and Radix. The choice depends on how much control the project needs, and how close I need to stay to the primitives.",

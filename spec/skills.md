## 1. Vercel React Best Practices

**Publisher:** Vercel  
**Version:** `1.0.0`  
**When to load:** Writing, reviewing, or refactoring React and Next.js code where performance matters: data fetching, bundle size, rendering, server/client boundaries, or re-render behavior

### Purpose

Performance optimization guidance for React and Next.js applications. This skill contains 58 rules across 8 priority-ranked categories, starting with async waterfall elimination and bundle size optimization, then moving through server performance, client fetching, re-render reduction, rendering behavior, JavaScript performance, and advanced patterns.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **`async-defer-await`** - Move `await` into the branch where the result is actually needed
2. **`async-parallel`** - Use `Promise.all()` for independent async work
3. **`async-suspense-boundaries`** - Use `<Suspense>` to stream slow subtrees progressively
4. **`bundle-barrel-imports`** - Import directly from source files instead of barrel files
5. **`bundle-dynamic-imports`** - Use `next/dynamic` for heavy components and defer their JS cost
6. **`server-cache-react`** - Use `React.cache()` for per-request deduplication in Server Components
7. **`server-parallel-fetching`** - Restructure component trees so server fetches start in parallel
8. **`rerender-memo`** - Extract expensive work into memoized components instead of recomputing inline
9. **`rerender-derived-state-no-effect`** - Derive state during render rather than syncing it with effects
10. **`rerender-functional-setstate`** - Use functional `setState` whenever the next value depends on previous state

## 2. Next.js Best Practices

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Topic-index skill with 19 linked reference files  
**When to load:** Writing or reviewing Next.js App Router code involving route structure, RSC boundaries, async APIs, runtime selection, metadata, route handlers, bundling, hydration, Suspense, or deployment

### Purpose

Topic-based guidance for modern Next.js applications. `SKILL.md` points to focused topic files covering file conventions, async APIs, directives, runtime choice, error handling, data patterns, route handlers, metadata, optimization primitives, hydration, Suspense, advanced routing, self-hosting, and debugging.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **File conventions first** - Use the correct App Router file and folder conventions, including modern route segment patterns
2. **Respect RSC boundaries** - Never build invalid Server/Client Component combinations or pass non-serializable props across the boundary
3. **Await async request APIs** - In Next.js 15+, treat `params`, `searchParams`, `cookies()`, and `headers()` as async
4. **Choose runtime intentionally** - Default to Node.js runtime unless Edge is clearly justified
5. **Use directives correctly** - Push `'use client'` as deep as possible and apply `'use cache'` where appropriate
6. **Use the right primitive for data work** - Distinguish between Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers
7. **Handle routing errors explicitly** - Use `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, redirects, and auth-oriented error helpers
8. **Optimize framework primitives** - Prefer `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/script`, and correct metadata APIs over manual equivalents
9. **Guard against hydration and CSR bailouts** - Wrap hooks like `useSearchParams` in `<Suspense>` and fix common hydration mismatch causes
10. **Understand advanced routing and deployment** - Apply parallel routes, intercepting routes, standalone output, cache handlers, and targeted debugging tools when needed

## 3. React Composition Patterns

**Publisher:** Vercel  
**Version:** `1.0.0`  
**When to load:** Refactoring components with too many flags, designing reusable component APIs, building compound components, or improving state architecture and React 19 readiness

### Purpose

Composition-oriented guidance for building flexible React components without boolean-prop sprawl. The skill is organized into 4 priority-ranked categories and exposes 8 rule files covering architecture, state management, implementation patterns, and React 19 API updates.

### Top 8 Rules by Priority

1. **`architecture-avoid-boolean-props`** - Avoid boolean props for behavior switches; compose variants instead
2. **`architecture-compound-components`** - Use shared-context compound components for complex UI
3. **`state-decouple-implementation`** - Keep state implementation details inside the provider
4. **`state-context-interface`** - Model context around `state`, `actions`, and `meta`
5. **`state-lift-state`** - Lift shared state into providers when siblings need it
6. **`patterns-explicit-variants`** - Prefer explicit variant components over mode/config props
7. **`patterns-children-over-render-props`** - Prefer composition through `children` over `renderX` props
8. **`react19-no-forwardref`** - In React 19+, stop defaulting to `forwardRef` and update APIs accordingly

## 4. Design Engineering

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file craft and UI polish skill  
**When to load:** Reviewing or building polished UI where taste, animation decisions, component feel, interaction quality, and subtle implementation details matter

### Purpose

This skill encodes a design-engineering mindset rather than a narrow API checklist. It combines philosophy, review format requirements, animation decision-making, component interaction standards, performance rules, accessibility notes, and debugging advice into a single self-contained document.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Taste is trained** - Study excellent products and make deliberate visual choices rather than stopping at "works"
2. **Unseen details compound** - Small implementation details add up to perceived quality
3. **Beauty is leverage** - Good defaults, motion, and polish are product differentiators
4. **Review format is mandatory** - UI reviews must use a markdown table with `Before | After | Why`
5. **Do not animate high-frequency keyboard actions** - Repeated actions should feel instant, not ornamental
6. **Every animation needs a purpose** - Use motion for state, feedback, spatial consistency, explanation, or to avoid jarring changes
7. **Use strong easing and avoid `ease-in` for UI** - Default to `ease-out` or custom curves that feel responsive
8. **Keep UI motion fast** - Common interface animations should usually stay under 300ms
9. **Buttons and popovers need physicality** - Use subtle press scaling, origin-aware popovers, and never animate from `scale(0)`
10. **Prefer performant, interruptible motion** - Favor transforms, opacity, transitions, reduced-motion support, and techniques that stay smooth under load

## 5. Fixing Motion Performance

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file audit and remediation skill  
**When to load:** Investigating janky animations, layout thrash, scroll-linked motion problems, heavy blur/filter effects, or mixed animation systems in existing UI code

### Purpose

Focused performance-review guidance for animation systems. The skill defines a rendering glossary, 9 priority-ranked rule categories, concrete anti-patterns, and code-level remediation strategies while explicitly requiring fixes to stay within the existing animation stack unless a migration is requested.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Do not interleave layout reads and writes** - Avoid layout thrash inside the same frame
2. **Default to `transform` and `opacity`** - Start with compositor-friendly motion before considering paint or layout animation
3. **Do not animate layout continuously on large surfaces** - Layout animation is only acceptable on small, isolated areas
4. **Do not drive animation from scroll events** - Prefer Scroll/View Timelines or IntersectionObserver-based triggers
5. **Measure once, animate later** - Batch DOM reads, then animate with FLIP-style transforms or opacity
6. **Pause work when off-screen** - Stop or reduce motion users cannot currently see
7. **Avoid paint-heavy animation on large elements** - Filters, masks, gradients, and similar properties need strict limits
8. **Do not animate inherited CSS variables for motion** - Scope animated variables locally or write transforms directly
9. **Keep blur small and short-lived** - Blur should stay modest, never run continuously, and never cover large surfaces
10. **Do not partially migrate animation tools** - Fix issues inside the current stack unless the user explicitly requests a rewrite

## 6. React useEffect

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Official-docs-inspired guidance focused on when not to use `useEffect`  
**When to load:** Writing or reviewing `useEffect`, derived state, event-driven logic, data fetching, state synchronization, or any React code where effects may be overused

### Purpose

Focused React guidance based on the principle that Effects are an escape hatch for synchronizing with external systems, not a default tool for ordinary state and rendering logic. The skill teaches when to replace `useEffect` with render-time calculation, `useMemo`, event handlers, `key` props, lifted state, or subscription-specific APIs.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Use Effects only for external synchronization** - If no external system is involved, an Effect is usually the wrong tool
2. **Do not derive state with `useEffect`** - Compute values from props and state during render instead
3. **Do not use Effects to respond to user events** - Put that logic directly in the event handler
4. **Use `useMemo` for expensive pure calculations** - Do not cache render-derived values with `useEffect`
5. **Use `key` props to reset state on identity changes** - Do not manually reset state in an Effect when component identity changed
6. **Avoid chaining state updates through Effects** - Calculate the next state in one place instead of reacting after the fact
7. **Call parent callbacks at the source of change** - Do not watch local state in an Effect just to notify parents
8. **Use cleanup for data fetching when Effects are required** - Or prefer framework-native data-fetching mechanisms when available
9. **Use `useSyncExternalStore` for subscriptions when possible** - Prefer subscription-specific React APIs over ad hoc Effects
10. **Start from the decision tree** - Distinguish between event handler, Effect, render-time calculation, `useMemo`, and `key`-based reset before writing code

### Available Files

| File               | Description                                                                        |

## 7. SEO Audit

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version:** `1.1.0`  
**When to load:** Auditing, reviewing, or diagnosing SEO issues on a site, especially around indexing, crawlability, rankings, technical SEO, on-page SEO, traffic drops, Core Web Vitals, or organic-search performance problems

### Purpose

Structured SEO audit guidance for diagnosing why a site is underperforming in organic search. The skill is built around a clear priority order: crawlability and indexation first, then technical foundations, on-page optimization, content quality, and authority. It also includes an explicit warning about schema-markup detection limits when using static fetch tools.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Start with context** - Understand the site type, business goal, priority keywords, recent changes, and audit scope before judging issues
2. **Check product marketing context first** - Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` when present before asking redundant questions
3. **Prioritize crawlability and indexation first** - Confirm Google can discover, crawl, and index the important URLs before anything else
4. **Audit robots.txt and XML sitemaps** - Look for accidental blocks, missing sitemap references, and non-canonical URLs in the sitemap
5. **Validate canonicalization and indexation signals** - Check `noindex`, canonicals, redirects, duplicate content, and soft 404 patterns
6. **Review Core Web Vitals and technical speed factors** - Focus on LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB, JS, CSS, images, caching, CDN, and font loading
7. **Audit mobile-first readiness** - Verify responsive behavior, tap targets, viewport config, and content parity with desktop
8. **Check core on-page elements page by page** - Review titles, meta descriptions, headings, content depth, images, internal links, and keyword targeting
9. **Do not claim schema is missing from static HTML alone** - JS-injected JSON-LD often will not appear in `curl` or static fetch output
10. **Deliver prioritized, actionable findings** - Organize results into executive summary, evidence-backed findings, and a practical action plan

## 8. Make Interfaces Feel Better

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** UI polish skill with 4 focused reference files  
**When to load:** Refining interface feel, visual polish, typography, shadows, hover/press states, enter/exit animations, or reviewing why a UI feels slightly off

### Purpose

Practical design-engineering guidance focused on the small details that compound into a polished interface. The skill emphasizes typography, surfaces, animation feel, and performance hygiene, with short rules that are especially useful during UI review and final refinement passes.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Concentric border radius** - Nested rounded elements should use radii derived from padding, not identical corner values
2. **Optical over geometric alignment** - Icons and asymmetrical shapes often need manual visual alignment
3. **Shadows over borders** - Prefer layered, transparent depth over hard visual separation where appropriate
4. **Interruptible animations** - Use transitions for interactive states so motion can retarget smoothly
5. **Split and stagger enter animations** - Animate semantic chunks, not a single large container
6. **Subtle exit animations** - Keep exits softer with small fixed offsets instead of dramatic travel
7. **Contextual icon animations** - Icon swaps should use opacity, scale, and blur thoughtfully
8. **Font smoothing** - Apply antialiasing for crisper text rendering on macOS/retina displays
9. **Tabular numbers** - Use tabular numerals for dynamic or comparable values to prevent layout jitter
10. **Text wrapping** - Use `text-wrap: balance` for headings and `text-wrap: pretty` for body copy

## 10. Tailwind CSS Patterns

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file utility-first styling guide with a supporting reference  
**When to load:** Building or refining Tailwind-based UI where responsive layout, spacing, typography, states, accessibility, or reusable utility composition matter

### Purpose

Practical Tailwind guidance for day-to-day component work. The skill focuses on mobile-first styling, consistent use of design tokens, composed utility patterns, responsive layouts, accessibility states, and keeping repeated class patterns intentional rather than ad hoc.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Start mobile-first** - Write the base layout for small screens first and add breakpoint prefixes only where needed
2. **Use design tokens over arbitrary values** - Prefer Tailwind scales for spacing, color, and type whenever possible
3. **Compose utilities deliberately** - Build clear utility groups instead of scattered one-off classes
4. **Extract repeated patterns** - Turn recurring utility bundles into shared components or class helpers
5. **Use semantic layout primitives** - Flexbox for one-dimensional alignment, grid for two-dimensional structure
6. **Respect interaction states** - Hover, focus, active, disabled, and reduced-motion states all need explicit styling
7. **Keep accessibility visible** - Preserve focus rings, touch targets, and contrast rather than styling them away
8. **Use responsive typography and spacing** - Let layout density expand with breakpoint changes instead of staying rigid
9. **Test responsive behavior intentionally** - Verify small, medium, and large layouts instead of assuming utilities compose well
10. **Keep production output clean** - Favor maintainable class composition and valid content paths over brittle dynamic utilities

## 11. Tailwind Design System

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file Tailwind v4 design-system skill  
**When to load:** Creating component libraries, implementing design tokens, standardizing UI patterns, or migrating Tailwind v3 design systems to v4

### Purpose

Tailwind CSS v4 design-system guidance centered on CSS-first configuration, semantic tokens, component variants, dark mode, reusable patterns, and migration from older config-driven setups.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Model the system with semantic tokens** - Define colors, radii, and animation tokens in `@theme`, not ad hoc component classes
2. **Use Tailwind v4 CSS-first configuration** - Prefer `@theme` and CSS-native customization over legacy `tailwind.config.ts` habits
3. **Standardize variants intentionally** - Build a consistent component API for visual variants and sizes
4. **Treat dark mode as a first-class system concern** - Encode theme behavior through shared tokens and variants, not scattered overrides
5. **Design for accessibility at the token level** - Focus rings, contrast, and motion defaults should be part of the system itself
6. **Prefer reusable utility composition over duplication** - Keep repeated patterns in one place
7. **Use responsive patterns as system primitives** - Treat spacing, typography, and component density across breakpoints as deliberate tokens
8. **Build utility helpers for consistency** - Use shared functions and variant helpers where they reduce drift
9. **Plan migration explicitly** - When coming from v3, map old config concepts cleanly into v4 primitives
10. **Keep the design system production-ready** - Optimize for maintainability, predictable extension, and multi-component consistency

## 12. Tailwind CSS Advanced Layouts

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file advanced layout technique guide  
**When to load:** Solving tricky layout problems with CSS Grid, Flexbox, sticky positioning, scrolling containers, fluid sizing, or layered responsive structure

### Purpose

Focused layout guidance for more complex Tailwind work. The skill emphasizes robust grid and flex patterns, fluid sizing, safe overflow handling, sticky and fixed positioning, scroll behavior, and layout patterns that hold up across breakpoints.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Use the right layout model** - Reach for grid for two-dimensional composition and flex for one-dimensional alignment
2. **Prevent overflow blowouts** - Add `min-w-0`, `overflow-hidden`, and resilient track sizing where text or content can stretch containers
3. **Use fluid sizing where fixed widths fail** - Prefer `min()`, `max()`, `minmax()`, and `clamp()` for responsive surfaces
4. **Handle mobile toolbars deliberately** - Use scrollable rows, sticky positioning, and fixed actions intentionally on small screens
5. **Build safe sticky layers** - Sticky headers and sidebars need explicit offsets, z-index discipline, and backdrop treatment
6. **Use scroll containers intentionally** - Horizontal overflow, snap, and scroll padding should feel designed rather than incidental
7. **Design for shrinking content** - Flex and grid children should opt into shrink behavior when labels or values can be long
8. **Prefer semantic spacing structures** - Use gaps and logical spacing instead of brittle margins
9. **Use container-aware responsiveness when helpful** - Let components respond to their own space, not only the viewport
10. **Test breakpoint edge cases** - Validate narrow mobile widths, intermediate tablet widths, and dense desktop layouts for blowouts and awkward wrapping

## 13. TypeScript Advanced Types

**Publisher:** Project-local  
**Version / Notes:** Single-file advanced type system skill  
**When to load:** Building complex generic utilities, type-safe APIs, event systems, validation layers, advanced reducers, or any TypeScript-heavy feature where `any` would otherwise creep in

### Purpose

Comprehensive TypeScript type-system guidance in one file. The skill walks through generics, conditional types, mapped types, template literal types, utility types, inference techniques, advanced patterns, type testing, common pitfalls, and compile-time performance considerations.

### Top 10 Rules by Priority

1. **Use `unknown` over `any`** - Preserve type safety and force narrowing
2. **Use conditional types with `infer`** - Extract inner types without runtime code
3. **Prefer discriminated unions over vague optional objects** - Model real state machines explicitly
4. **Use mapped types to transform shapes** - Derive types instead of manually duplicating them
5. **Constrain generics with `extends`** - Express the minimum contract a generic needs
6. **Use template literal types for string conventions** - Encode naming and path rules in types
7. **Prefer type guards and assertion functions over unchecked casts** - Narrow safely at runtime
8. **Reach for deep utility types when needed** - Nested state and config often need recursive helpers
9. **Test your types** - Use compile-time equality helpers to prevent regression
10. **Keep advanced types readable and performant** - Avoid overly deep conditional nesting and recursive complexity when simpler forms work

## Completed

- `sourceHref` made optional in Zod schema (`source.config.ts`) and nullable in `ProjectContent` type; conditional spread in `project-actions.tsx` and `project-detail-page.tsx` — closed-source projects show no GitHub icon
- `screenshotSrc` field removed from Zod schema and all 7 project MDX frontmatter files
- All 7 project `description` frontmatter fields rewritten: keyword-optimized 140–160 char versions for reway, forge, rootly, devloop, danadoors, mosexperiences, markymap
- `homepageSceneVisited` module-level flag re-added in `homepage-scene-motion.ts`; `useSceneDelay` uses `useRef` capture at mount to skip stagger on client-side navigation return
- Dock excluded from stagger by removing `revealDelayMs` prop; no module-level flag needed
- Stagger distances and durations tightened across all four tiers (body 14→10px / 0.42→0.38s, surface 12→8px / 0.38→0.34s, header 8→6px, utility 6→4px)
- `pendingActiveId` `useEffect` replaced with inline derived render value in `animated-icon-link-group.tsx` (per `/react-useeffect` skill)
- Real social URLs set in `lib/content/identity.ts`: GitHub, LinkedIn, X; email `mohamed.g.shoaib@gmail.com`
- `homepageCopy.about`: 3-paragraph real about text (joined `\n\n`, split to `<p>` tags during render)
- `homepageCopy.approach`: 2-paragraph real approach text (same pattern)
- `app/page.tsx`: avatar `alt` set to "Mohamed Gamal"; H1 `<div>` wrapper changed to `<hgroup>`; `projectsHeader` delay corrected to 220ms
- Homepage H1 and root route title include "Frontend Engineer" keyword
- Root meta description rewritten: React/Next.js/Cairo keywords, ~160 chars
- `/projects` and `/writing` meta descriptions expanded to ~160 chars with stack keywords
- OG/Twitter image bindings added to `site-metadata.ts`: `openGraph.images` and `twitter.images` arrays; `twitter.creator` uses `siteConfig.twitterHandle` (`@mo0hamed_gamal`)
- `siteConfig.twitterHandle` added to `lib/metadata/site-config.ts`
- `createBreadcrumbJsonLd()` added to `lib/metadata/structured-data.ts`; injected on `app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` and `app/writing/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Alt text fixed: avatar `alt="Mohamed Gamal"`, `ProjectMediaPlaceholder` uses `label` prop, `ProjectCard` `ProjectMediaFrame` uses `"{name} project screenshot"`
- `robots.ts` updated: `disallow: ["/api/", "/_next/"]` added
- Stale placeholder note removed from `renderLlmsFullTxt()` in `lib/content/agent-discovery.ts`
- `/projects` and `/writing` page descriptions replaced with real two-paragraph copy
- Writing MDX AI rhythm patterns fixed: `ai-discovery` "That distinction is important. One is... The other is..." collapsed to single sentence; em dashes removed from both writing posts
- `react-in-2026` structural patterns fixed: "Instead of starting with..." → direct claim; "The point is not to eliminate them..." → replaced; "That kind of early shape work..." → "Early boundary work..."; anadiplosis sentence pair → "Those choices remove moving parts. Fewer moving parts means less to break and less to explain."
- `markymap.mdx` body "whether through heavy interfaces..." rewritten to remove "whether X, Y, or Z" AI structural pattern

## Decisions

- `sourceHref: string | null` (not `undefined`) — nullable type is explicit and safe at all callsites; optional in Zod, nullable in TypeScript
- Module-level `homepageSceneVisited` flag is intentional — survives client-side navigation because it lives outside React lifecycle; captured at mount via `useRef` so `useState` initializes as ready on return visits
- Em dashes prohibited in all content and code-generated copy — enforced going forward

## Blockers

1. Task 15: favicon and apple-touch-icon — waiting on user to provide `app/icon.png` (32×32) and `app/apple-icon.png` (180×180)
2. Task 16: expand project MDX pages to 400–600 words — waiting on user content per project
3. Task 17: publish 5–8 additional writing posts — waiting on user drafts

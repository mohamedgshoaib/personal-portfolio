## Session Log — 2026-06-05-portfolio-spec-icon-system

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Timezone:** UTC+02:00 (Cairo)
**Time:** Ended 11:07 PM

## Status at Start

- **Sprint goal:** Replace placeholder project DNA with a usable product spec and align the UI system around Coss, Base UI, and Tabler icons.
- **Last blocker:** `spec/index.md` and `spec/skills.md` were template-level and did not describe the actual portfolio system.
- **Feature state:** Starter Next.js app with Coss UI components present and homepage still on the scaffold screen.

---

## Completed

- Replaced `spec/index.md` with a concrete spec for Mohamed Gamal's personal portfolio and writing site.
- Filled `spec/skills.md` with the 17 installed local skills and verified every listed skill path exists.
- Corrected the UI stack in `spec/index.md` to Coss UI on Base UI and documented Tabler icon conventions.
- Replaced `lucide-react` with `@tabler/icons-react` in `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `components.json`, and shared `components/ui/*` imports.
- Updated shared UI icon choices to the confirmed Tabler filled square/rounded icon set.
- Added a temporary homepage icon preview grid in `app/page.tsx`, verified it locally, then removed it and restored the starter homepage.
- Verified `pnpm typecheck` passes.
- Verified targeted ESLint passes for `app/page.tsx` and `components/ui`.

## Decisions

- The site direction is a calm, narrow, editorial, text-led portfolio and writing system rather than a one-page portfolio performance.
- Shared UI should use Coss UI built on Base UI; Radix is not the component system direction for the spec.
- Project icons should use `@tabler/icons-react`, with filled-style icons by default when a filled variant exists.
- Confirmed default UI icon set includes square/rounded Tabler variants for close, checks, alerts, info, chevrons, plus/minus, and `IconLoader` for loading.

## Blockers

1. Repo-wide `pnpm lint` still fails because ESLint includes `.agents/skills/typescript-expert/references/utility-types.ts` and `.claude/skills/typescript-expert/references/utility-types.ts`, which contain `no-explicit-any` errors.
2. ~~Repo-wide `pnpm lint` still reports an existing unused font import warning in `app/layout.tsx`.~~ Resolved 2026-06-08 when fonts moved to local self-hosted fonts.
